The Stripe machine-learning fraud systems can block many fraudulent payments for you, but you can also set up rules that are unique to your business using the supported attributes.\nRule processing and ordering\nThe action a rule takes determines the order in which it\u2019s processed. Radar evaluates each payment against the rules you create and rules have the following order of priority:\n- Request 3DS: Rules that when used with the Payment Intents API or Checkout, request 3D Secure authentication. Radar evaluates these before any block, review or allow rules.\n- Allow: Rules that allow a payment to be processed. Payments that fall under allow rules aren\u2019t evaluated against any block or review rules.\n- Block: Rules that block a payment and reject it. Blocked payments aren\u2019t evaluated against any review rules.\n- Review: Rules that allow payments to be processed but then place them in review.\nIf a payment matches the criteria for a rule, Radar takes the appropriate action and the payment isn\u2019t evaluated any further. If a payment matches an allow rule, it\u2019s processed normally\u2013no block or review rules are subsequently evaluated, even if the payment would also meet their criteria. An example set of rules might be as follows:\n- Allow payments less than\n$10\n- Allow payments made within the US and with a risk level of\nnormal\n- Block payments where the risk level is\nhigh\n- Block payments\ngreater than $1,000\n- Review payments made with a card issued\noutside the US\nUsing the rules above, all payments less than 10 USD would be processed, regardless of their risk level or where the card was issued. This is because the first rule allows the payment, so no further rules are evaluated. Similarly, a 1,500 payment USD made within the US with a normal risk level would also be allowed, despite the rule to block payments over 1,000 USD. This is because of the second rule in the list, allowing payments made within the US and a normal risk level. When a particular rule is triggered, no further rules are evaluated.\nRule structure\nThe rule structure has two components\u2014the action it should take and the condition to evaluate:\n{action} if {condition}\nTogether they are referred to as the predicate. In practice, a rule to block all payments over 1,000 USD would appear as:\nBlock if :amount_in_usd: > 1000.00\n- The action is\nBlock\n- The condition is\n:amount_in_usd: > 1000.00\nActions\nA rule can perform one of four actions with a payment that meets its criteria, processed in this specific order.\nRequest 3DS\nWhen used with the Payment Intents API, this rule determines if the customer must follow prompts to go through 3D Secure authentication. Regardless of matches on this rule, Allow, Block, and Review rules are evaluated after it.\nAllow\nThis rule determines when to always allow a payment that meets certain criteria, regardless of Stripe\u2019s evaluation or any other matching rules. When a payment matches the criteria in an allow rule, Stripe processes it normally and it\u2019s not subject to further rules evaluation. Even if Stripe proceeds with a payment, the card issuer may still decline it.\nBlock\nBlock rules specify that Stripe should always block a payment. If a payment matches the criteria in a block rule, Stripe rejects it and it\u2019s not subject to further rules evaluation.\nReview\nYou might want to allow certain types of payments but also have the option to examine them more closely. With review rules, you can place payments in review. This is especially useful for payments that don\u2019t fit common patterns, such as larger payments or payments from a country that you don\u2019t often ship to. Stripe still processes these payments and charges the customer, but you have an additional opportunity to review the order and check for signs of fraud.\nConditions\nIf a payment matches a rule\u2019s condition, the corresponding action is taken.

A basic condition is, itself, made up of three parts:\n[attribute] [operator] [value]\n- Attribute: The attribute of a payment (for example, the amount or type of card)\n- Operator: The arithmetic that compares the attribute to the value (for example, greater than or not equal to)\n- Value: The criteria you want to use (for example,\n100.00or\ndebit)\nCombining both the action and condition together, the structure of a rule is:\n{action} if {[attribute] [operator] [value]}\nFour types of conditions exist, depending on the attribute type:\n[string_attribute] [operator] [string_value]\n[country_attribute] [operator] [country_value]\n[numeric_attribute] [operator] [numeric_value]\n[boolean_attribute]\nYou can also use certain attributes as a corresponding value within a condition. For instance, you can create a rule to block payments where the issuing country of the card doesn\u2019t match with the country where the payment was made, using the following attribute and value:\nBlock if :card_country: != :ip_country:\nFor a list of all possible conditions, refer to the supported attributes.\nString attributes\nThese contain any combination of characters. String attributes and values most commonly represent a piece of text, such as a card\u2019s brand (for example,\nvisa,\namex) or risk level (for example,\nelevated). You can use these in rules to allow payments only from a particular country, or block payments made with prepaid cards.\nMetadata attributes\nThese attributes are derived from the metadata you\u2019ve attached to your payments. Metadata attributes can operate as either strings or numbers. When used as strings, metadata attributes are case-sensitive.\nYou can use these attributes when creating Stripe Radar rules, enabling you to write rules against any custom business attributes you have passed to Stripe in the metadata field attached to your payments.\nMetadata attributes are written in the following structure:\n::[metadata_value]:: [operator]\nFor example, suppose we have payments with the following key-value data stored in the metadata field:\n|Metadata Name||Metadata Value|\n|Customer Age||22|\n|Item ID||5A381D|\n|Category ID||groceries|\nYou can write a rule to place payments that match the following criteria into review.\nReview if < 30\nYou can also write rules using both metadata attributes and other supported attributes mentioned in this document. For example, you can write a rule that only places a payment in review if the\nItem ID matches\n5A381D and the payment amount exceeds 1,000 USD.\nReview if =\n'5A381D' and :amount_in_usd: > 1000\nMetadata attributes also support the\nIN operator to match against multiple values. For example, you can write a rule that places a payment in review if the\nCategory ID is one of groceries, electronics, or clothing.\nReview if IN (\n'groceries',\n'electronics',\n'clothing')\nYou can use the\nINCLUDES operator with rules for metadata attributes and other string attributes to match substrings. For example, you can write a rule that places a payment in review if the\nItem ID includes the string\nA381. This matches A381, 5A381D, A381D, 5A381, and more.\nReview if INCLUDES\n'A381'\nCaution\nMetadata attributes are case-sensitive when used as strings. Make sure that metadata values you specify in rules are exactly the same as the ones attached to your payments.\nMetadata on Customer and Destination Objects\nYou can also access metadata on customer and destination objects (if those are used for a given payment). These attributes use the following structure:\n::[customer|destination]:[metadata_value]:: [operator]\nFor example, suppose you had a customer with the following metadata:\n|Metadata Name||Metadata Value|\n|Trusted||true|\nYou could write a rule that always allows payments if the customer\u2019s\nTrusted metadata field is\ntrue.\nAllow if =\n'true'\nOr if you had a destination with the following", "start_char_idx": 3980, "end_char_idx": 7845, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "628d83d7-8f00-4f9e-81dd-608cf363cb10": {"__data__": {"id_": "628d83d7-8f00-4f9e-81dd-608cf363cb10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c1cb3a0-5ad6-4610-9674-f922027fbd9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7adf65e831e1de2cbf66a42456ae04eb581d6947e61fd1dcc7de5051e5e163dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1d8de88-b5f3-43c2-bf31-50577bfdaca7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8cf39f0c09e74c466cf7e135a4fa80deaabff5fa04b75de94027805019c0a1f7"}, "3": {"node_id": "490a99a9-87cd-45f0-981a-e1c0373ca30c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d868e46e1d9bee9f335c120597b3662e781c9ccb58a808fe78a1bf11810d1d6"}}, "hash": "1523eb19fddb5e0879b062bbd39e99fc65f30d7cdd8de34e869fd7fbf1e63cf9", "text": "if =\n'true'\nOr if you had a destination with the following metadata:\n|Metadata Name||Metadata Value|\n|Category||new|\nYou could write a rule that places a payment in review if the destination\u2019s\nCategory metadata field is\nnew.\nReview if =\n'new'\nCountry attributes\nThese use two-letter country codes to represent a country, such as\nUS for United States,\nGB for Great Britain, or\nAR for Argentina. Country attributes operate the same as string attributes, the only difference being that the value must be a country code.\nState attributes\nThese use ISO codes to represent the state or principal subdivision of a country, such as\nCA to represent California of the United States,\nENG to represent England which is part of Great Britain, or\nL to represent La Pampa which is part of Argentina. We omit the two-letter country code from the state ISO code, so if you want to block transactions from California, your rule would compare the state attribute to\nCA.\nBlock if :ip_state: =\n'CA'\nState attributes operate the same as string attributes, the only difference being that the value must be an ISO code.\nNumeric attributes\nAs these contain only numbers, they support more operators than string attributes and values. A payment\u2019s amount is one example of a numeric attribute. You can create a rule to perform an action if the amount is higher, lower, equal, or not equal to the amount you specify.\nFor numeric attributes that are counts over time windows, the count excludes the payment that you\u2019re currently processing. For example,\ntotal_charges_per_customer_hourly represents the number of previous charge attempts from a given customer in the preceding hour. So, for the first charge attempt in a given hour for a customer,\ntotal_charges_per_customer_hourly has a value of\n0. For a second charge attempt within the same hour, it has a value of\n1, and so on.\nTime-since-first-seen attributes also don\u2019t take into account the payment you\u2019re currently processing. For example, a payment without an email has a missing value for\nseconds_since_email_first_seen. So do payments with emails never seen before on your account (since we don\u2019t include the payment currently being processed, this is effectively the same behavior as the first example). See below for more details about missing values. The\nseconds_since_email_first_seen field is only non-null after a new payment with a given email is processed.\nBounded numeric attributes\nBounded numeric attributes are similar to the numeric attributes described above. For example, they exclude the payment that you\u2019re currently processing. The difference is that the available values for bounded numeric attributes are capped (or bounded) at a specific value.\nAs an example, take\nauthorized_charges_per_email_hourly which represents the number of previous charges that were authorized for the email in the past hour on your account. For the sake of the example, let\u2019s say it has a bound of\n5. For the first charge attempt in the past hour with the email\njenny.rosen@example.com the counter has a value of\n0. Subsequent charge attempts in the same hour see higher counter values. After authorizing the 6th charge within the hour from\njenny.rosen@example.com, the counter stops incrementing and stays at\n5 despite actually having\n6 charge attempts in the past hour.\nIf an attempt to increment the counter above the cap occurs, we exclude older values from consideration and replace them with newer values. For example, consider a counter with a cap of\n3 that\u2019s been filled up with 3 charges. One way to visualize the counter is by maintaining a list of timestamps representing arrival times of charges:\n[10, 20, 30] for instance. When a charge arrives at time\n50, the counter now looks like\n[20, 30, 50].\nBoolean attributes\nA Boolean attribute represents whether a particular attribute is true. Unlike string and numeric attributes, Boolean attributes have no operators or values. You can use a Boolean attribute to block payments that have been made with a disposable email address, or place payments in review that were made with an anonymous IP", "start_char_idx": 7862, "end_char_idx": 11945, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "490a99a9-87cd-45f0-981a-e1c0373ca30c": {"__data__": {"id_": "490a99a9-87cd-45f0-981a-e1c0373ca30c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c1cb3a0-5ad6-4610-9674-f922027fbd9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7adf65e831e1de2cbf66a42456ae04eb581d6947e61fd1dcc7de5051e5e163dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "628d83d7-8f00-4f9e-81dd-608cf363cb10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1523eb19fddb5e0879b062bbd39e99fc65f30d7cdd8de34e869fd7fbf1e63cf9"}, "3": {"node_id": "5327813b-8ac5-4ae8-ab2b-ad14b74627aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "127fdb025c33efcd423f800269a67faa433235da8b2c92ada541d311caaac722"}}, "hash": "5d868e46e1d9bee9f335c120597b3662e781c9ccb58a808fe78a1bf11810d1d6", "text": "disposable email address, or place payments in review that were made with an anonymous IP address.\nPost-authorization attributes\nA post-authorization attribute (for example,\n:cvc_check:,\n:address_zip_check:, or\n:address_line1_check:) requires Stripe to exchange data with card issuers as part of the authorization process.

(This won\u2019t affect whether a charge is blocked or not, but may impact which rule blocks the charge.)\nIf you use a post-authorization attribute in a rule, your customer\u2019s statement may temporarily show an authorization even if the charge is ultimately blocked\u2014the authorization generally disappears after a few days.\nAddress and CVC attributes have five possible values:\n|Attribute value||Explanation|\n|The data provided is correct.|\n|The data provided is incorrect.|\n|The customer\u2019s card issuer won\u2019t check the data provided. Not all card issuers or countries support address verification.|\n|The data was provided but hasn\u2019t been checked yet. The customer\u2019s card issuer will eventually check the data provided.|\n|The data wasn\u2019t provided to Stripe.|\nSome example rules:\nBlock if :address_line1_check: =\n'fail'\nBlock if :cvc_check: !=\n'pass'\nBlock if :address_zip_check: in (\n'fail',\n'not_provided')\nSupported attributes\nRefer to the list of all supported attributes for a complete list of attributes you can apply to your rule definitions.\nConverted amounts\nWhen using\namount_in_xyz, Stripe automatically determines the converted amount of any payment when checking if the amount matches your chosen criteria. For example, if you create a rule using\namount_in_usd to block all payments greater than 1,000 USD, Stripe would block a payment of a lower nominal amount in a different currency (for example, 900 GBP) if its equivalent converted value exceeds 1,000 USD.\n\u201cTakes into account payments from 2020 onwards\u201d in practice\nThe descriptions of some rule attributes include the phrase \u201ctakes into account payments from 2020 onwards\u201d. This means that the rule would treat a card that last transacted with your business in 2019 the same as a card that\u2019s new to your business. You should carefully consider what this means in the context of your business and rules as it could result in counterintuitive behavior. For example, if you create a rule to block high-value payments from new cards, you might end up blocking a good customer who hasn\u2019t made a purchase since 2019.\n\u201cThis attribute only includes live mode Customer objects that interacted with your account in the past <week, year>. This data updates at most every 72 hours.\u201d in practice\nThe descriptions of some rule attributes include the sentences \u201cThis attribute only includes live mode Customer objects that interacted with your account in the past <week, year>. This data updates at most every 72 hours.\u201d This means that live mode Customer objects that were created, charged, or updated on your account in the past week or year are included in these counts. However, the count doesn\u2019t update immediately and might take up to 72 hours to propagate through the system, though often times these counters update sooner than 72 hours.\nOperators\nA condition\u2019s operator denotes the comparison between the payment\u2019s attribute and the value you provide. Different operators are available, depending on the type of attribute being used.\n|Operator||String||Metadata||Country||State||Numeric||Description||Example|\n|=||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||Equal to|\n|!=||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||Not equal to|\n|<||\u2714\ufe0e||Less than|\n|>||\u2714\ufe0e||Greater than|\n|<=||\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||Less than or equal", "start_char_idx": 11920, "end_char_idx": 15682, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5327813b-8ac5-4ae8-ab2b-ad14b74627aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "5327813b-8ac5-4ae8-ab2b-ad14b74627aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c1cb3a0-5ad6-4610-9674-f922027fbd9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7adf65e831e1de2cbf66a42456ae04eb581d6947e61fd1dcc7de5051e5e163dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "490a99a9-87cd-45f0-981a-e1c0373ca30c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d868e46e1d9bee9f335c120597b3662e781c9ccb58a808fe78a1bf11810d1d6"}, "3": {"node_id": "f9b308dc-8a82-4b07-a3da-ecef545b9506", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "59b36bbf4f142cf59a6ec5026c01e65e728a79cc96a1555d8ff8da4409a31433"}}, "hash": "127fdb025c33efcd423f800269a67faa433235da8b2c92ada541d311caaac722", "text": "than|\n|<=||\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||Less than or equal to|\n|>=||\u2714\ufe0e||Greater than or equal to|\n|IN||\u2714||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714\ufe0e||Is in the group|\n|INCLUDES||\u2714||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714||\u2714||Contains the string|\n|LIKE||\u2714||\u2714\ufe0e||\u2714||\u2714||Matches the given pattern. Use the wildcard character |\nLists\nYou can reference a group of values in your rules through lists. All list aliases referenced in rules must start with\n@. To construct a rule referencing a list, follow the structure:\n{action} [attribute] in [list]\nFor example, say you have a list of card countries you\u2019d like to block. You could write a rule using several\nOR clauses:\nBlock if :card_country: =\n'CA' OR :card_country: =\n'DE' OR :card_country: =\n'AE'\nYou could also write a rule using an inline list:\nBlock if :card_country: IN (\n'CA',\n'DE',\n'AE')\nYou could also create a list of card countries you want to block, named\ncard_countries_to_block. You can then add the countries of your choice to the list and reference that list in a rule:\nBlock if :card_country: in @card_countries_to_block\nReferencing a list in a rule allows you to edit a large number of items in one place instead of maintaining many individual rules.\nCaution\nEU merchants should be aware of the Geo-blocking Regulation and its prohibitions on blocking payments from customers based in EU member states. Learn more about this regulation.\nMissing attributes\nTypical rule conditions refer to attributes set on every payment, such as\n:card_country: (which is set on every card-based charge) or a metadata attribute you always send with your payment requests. In some scenarios an attribute might be missing, for example:\nYou have different checkout flows on your site, and some of them don\u2019t collect customers\u2019 email addresses\nYou\u2019ve only recently started using Stripe.js, and so\n:ip_country:is available on new payments, but not available on historical payments (which we search when previewing rules)\nFor some of your payments, a bug in your integration fails to set an expected metadata key\nHow rule conditions evaluate missing attributes\nConsider the rule\nBlock if :email_domain: = . If you didn\u2019t collect the customer\u2019s email address, the\n'definitelyfraud.com'\n:email_domain: attribute would be missing, and\u2014as you might expect\u2014the rule condition would not match the payment.\nNow consider the rule\nReview if :email_domain: != . If the\n'definitelysafe.com'\n:email_domain: attribute is missing, this rule also doesn\u2019t match the payment. This result might seem a bit surprising, as a missing value is not the same as\n. In this case, we interpret\n'definitelysafe.com'\n!= to mean \u201cthe attribute has some value other than\n'definitelysafe.com'\n,\u201d which a missing attribute doesn\u2019t satisfy.\n'definitelysafe.com'\nMore generally: any comparison (for example,\n=,\n!=,\n>,\n<) of a missing feature against another static value or feature (missing or present) always returns false.\nExplicit handling with the\nis_missing function\nIf you want to explicitly check for the existence of an attribute or metadata attribute, use the\nis_missing function. Provide this function with the attribute or metadata key that may be missing.\nFor example, you could write a rule to match all payments where you don\u2019t have access to a customer\u2019s email address:\nReview if is_missing(:email_domain:)\nOr you might write a rule to match all payments that have a certain metadata attribute set:\nReview if !(is_missing( ))\nYou can also use the\nis_missing function in\nOR or\nAND conjunctions:\nReview if is_missing(:email_domain:) OR :email_domain: IN", "start_char_idx": 15725, "end_char_idx": 19211, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9b308dc-8a82-4b07-a3da-ecef545b9506": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9b308dc-8a82-4b07-a3da-ecef545b9506", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c1cb3a0-5ad6-4610-9674-f922027fbd9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7adf65e831e1de2cbf66a42456ae04eb581d6947e61fd1dcc7de5051e5e163dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "5327813b-8ac5-4ae8-ab2b-ad14b74627aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "127fdb025c33efcd423f800269a67faa433235da8b2c92ada541d311caaac722"}}, "hash": "59b36bbf4f142cf59a6ec5026c01e65e728a79cc96a1555d8ff8da4409a31433", "text": "if is_missing(:email_domain:) OR :email_domain: IN (\n'yopmail.net',\n'yandex.ru')\nComplex conditions\nYou can build complex conditions by joining together basic conditions using the operators AND, OR, and NOT. You can also use their symbolic equivalents: &&, ||, and ! respectively.\nSimilar to programming languages such as C, Python, and SQL, Stripe supports standard operator precedence (order of operations). For instance, the complex condition:\n{condition_X} OR NOT {condition_Y} AND {condition_Z}\nis interpreted as:\n{condition_X} OR ((NOT {condition_Y}) AND {condition_Z})\nSub-conditional grouping within complex conditions is also supported using parentheses. For instance, you can amend the prior example to explicitly change the evaluation order of sub-predicates:\n({condition_X} OR (NOT {condition_Y})) AND {condition_Z}\n{condition_X} OR NOT ({condition_Y} AND {condition_Z})\nBy using parentheses in different locations, each of these complex conditions lead to different results.\nValid conditions\nThe following conditions are examples of correct use of attributes and a supported operator:\n:card_brand: =\n'amex'\n:card_country: !=\n'US'\n:amount_in_usd: >= 1000.00\n:is_anonymous_ip:\nInvalid conditions\nWhen creating a rule, Radar provides feedback if you attempt to use an invalid condition. For reference, the following are examples of invalid conditions, where the value for an attribute or the operator used isn\u2019t supported:\n:risk_level: <(string values can only make use of = or != operators)\n'highest'\n:ip_country: =(country values must be expressed in two-letter short code)\n'Canada'\n:amount_in_usd: >=(numeric values must be expressed in numbers)\n'one thousand dollars'\n:is_anonymous_ip: =(Boolean attributes are not used with operators or values)\n'true'", "start_char_idx": 19194, "end_char_idx": 20960, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24490eb2-b3a1-4d92-bb8a-adc982ebb186": {"__data__": {"id_": "24490eb2-b3a1-4d92-bb8a-adc982ebb186", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "43969891-f145-4113-9bc9-95813beae2c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2951273fe064550817a091896cf739238a5baa6c49a75d810f80ab3cb63230d8"}, "3": {"node_id": "75c5c22e-365b-4a2b-b425-51368bdb97ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "abb3fb1e592620bd675e7580fa6cdf53bdb9ab747e9e0b048ce8cfeed73ff924"}}, "hash": "f425e7e07cc54ff025179e216ad8614305980493e138767f5b564aaffcbca8c4", "text": "Supported attributes\nReview a complete list of attributes supported in Radar rules.\nThe following attributes can be used within Radar to write rules.
